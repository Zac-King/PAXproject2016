////* Coding Standards *////

script documentation:
	Before you commit your sripts to be tested, you must submit documentation 
	on how to use it and what's required to set it up for testing. This can
	be done via a readme .txt file, or a commented header at the top of your 
	script.

Commenting:
	once a function or some block of your code works and you know what it does,
	comment it.


script names:
	short and descriptive.

variable names:
	variables should be descriptive.
								e.g.	a variable representing the number of boxes in a stack could be: int stackedBoxes

Function names:
	Each word should start with a capital letter. Underscores should be used sparingly, only for organizational purposes within your script
